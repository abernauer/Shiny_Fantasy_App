#  Fantasy Baseball Draft Recap Shiny Application
A shiny application I created to store and display the draft results for my 2019 fantasy baseball league.
The app was a small project produced for a R studio internship application.


## Project Organization 
The Data/ directory contains a .Rmd file in which I cleaned the html data and transformed 
it into a format that was acceptable for presenting in tables. 

In the root directory the app.R file contains the actual code for the Shiny application.
