#  Fantasy Baseball Draft Recap Shiny Application
A shiny application I created to store and display the draft results for my 2019 fantasy baseball league.
The app was a small project produced for a R studio internship application.


## Project Organization 
The Data/ directory contains a .Rmd file in which I cleaned the html data and transformed 
it into a format that was acceptable for presenting in tables. 

In the root directory the app.R file contains the actual code for the Shiny application.

## Installation 
Assuming you have Git on your system in the terminal run.  


```bash
git clone https://github.com/abernauer/Shiny_Fantasy_App.git
```
